****** Instructions for Spacebuild Factions Content with Spacetech's Simple Prop Protection ******

Place this folder into your "garrysmod/gamemodes" folder.

- Spacebuild Factions requires a Spacebuild addon (Such as Spacebuild 2 or Spacebuild 3) to be installed.

- "Simple Prop Protection" was created by Spacetech and is included. Please do not use other prop protection at the same time. I have Spacetech's written permission to distribute this extended version (Simple RP Prop Protection) as a bundled component for the purpose of RP compatibility.

- Kathar has given permission to include his flags in other content packs. For that reason, they are incuded here.

- Special thanks of course to RingDing for creating Spacebuild Factions / Global RP / Aliens vs Humans RP
